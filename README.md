**Cloud-Based AI Recipe Generator**
This project is an AI-powered recipe recommendation system designed to help users decide what to cook based on the ingredients they have, their dietary preferences, and nutritional requirements. The system uses artificial intelligence, deep learning, and cloud computing to generate personalized recipes in real time. Its main goal is to simplify cooking decisions, reduce food waste, and promote healthier eating habits.


**Project Overview**
Many people struggle to decide what to cook due to limited ingredients, lack of experience, or specific dietary needs. Traditional recipe platforms often provide static and non-personalized results. This project addresses these issues by introducing an intelligent, adaptive recipe generator that creates customized recipes based on user input.
The application allows users to enter ingredients manually or through images and then generates step-by-step cooking instructions along with nutritional analysis. Over time, the system learns from user interactions to improve future recommendations.


**Key Features**

1.Generates recipes based on available ingredients

2.Supports dietary preferences and restrictions

3.Suggests suitable substitutes for missing or restricted ingredients

4.Produces step-by-step cooking instructions using AI

5.Provides nutritional analysis including calories and macronutrients

6.Cloud-based architecture for fast response and scalability

7.Web-based interface for easy interaction

8.Improves recommendations using user feedback


**Technologies Used**

1.Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

2.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

3.Attention Mechanism

4.Natural Language Processing (NLP)

5.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for ingredient recognition

6.Reinforcement Learning for recommendation improvement

7.Web and Cloud Technologies

8.Frontend: React.js

9.Backend: Flask or Django (REST APIs)

10.Cloud Platform: AWS (Lambda, RDS or DynamoDB)

11.Database: Recipe and nutrition datasets


**System Workflow**

1.The user provides ingredients through text or image input

2.Ingredients are identified using NLP or CNN-based models

3.The system matches ingredients with recipes and suggests substitutions

4.An RNN with attention generates step-by-step cooking instructions

5.Nutritional values are calculated and validated against dietary needs

6.The final recipe is presented with cooking steps, time, and nutrition details


**Performance Summary**

1.Fast recipe generation with responses in a few seconds

2.High accuracy in recipe relevance (approximately 90–95 percent)

3.Scalable cloud infrastructure supporting multiple users

4.Positive user feedback due to personalization and ease of use


**Datasets Used**

1.Recipe1M

2.RecipeNLG

3.Food-101

4.Custom nutrition datasets


**Applications**

1.Daily home cooking with limited ingredients

2.Diet-focused meal planning

3.Reducing household food waste

4.Health and nutrition recommendation systems

5.Smart kitchen and cloud-based food applications


**Future Scope**

1.Integration with smart kitchen and IoT devices

2.Voice-based cooking assistance

3.Region-specific and cuisine-based personalization

4.Transformer-based and multimodal recipe generation
